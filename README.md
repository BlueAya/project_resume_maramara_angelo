## jQuery Plugins
- [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js)
	- This jQuery plugin creates full screen scrolling websites.It can be viewed throughout my entire project. I broke off each of the required elements of the project into it's own section which you can scroll to with a smooth transition between each.
- [Splitchar.js](https://github.com/razvanbalosin/Splitchar.js)
	- This jQuery plugin allows you to add a class to an elment and it will split it into sections which you can then stylize however you please. I used this jQuery plugin on the headings of each of my sections.

## Comments
- I tried to take into consideration the height of my devices when designing this project. As I was using the Dev Tools, I found the iPhone 4 to be giving me the most problems. To accommodate for this particular device, I changed the default height in the fullPage.js as shown in my commit.
- This was a really cool way to always have a copy of your resume handy. Hopefully I'll be adding more relevant experience soon :).
